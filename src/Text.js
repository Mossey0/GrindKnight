const opener = `Once upon a time, in a peaceful village nestled at the edge of a vast forest, there lived a humble farmer named ${character}. For years, ${character} had tended to his fields, growing bountiful crops and caring for his livestock. Life was simple and serene, but it was not without its challenges. The village was often raided by monstrous creatures that emerged from the depths of the dark forest. These beasts would trample crops, steal livestock, and terrify the villagers.

One fateful day, after yet another devastating raid, ${character} decided he could no longer stand idly by while his beloved village suffered. With a heart full of determination, he rallied the villagers and shared his vision of a safer, brighter future. Inspired by his courage and leadership, the villagers elected him as their new governor.

${character} knew that to protect his people, he needed to build an army capable of vanquishing the monstrous foes once and for all.`;
